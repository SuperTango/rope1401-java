2. The simulator under ROPE does not keep up with the program when the code has been assembled several times.
    a. Fix this problem or
    b. Provide a reset button that will take back to initial state with code showing.
3.	If we went with the concept that each unique 1401 program resided in its own directory, we could place the ROPE.ini in that directory so that it is set for that program.
