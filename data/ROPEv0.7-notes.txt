New features of ROPE v0.7
-------------------------

The new assembler options of Autocoder v3.1 are supported.

  - In the EDIT window, click the "Assembler options ..." button.

  - In the Assembler Options dialog box:

      - You can select multiple directory paths for the
        macro library.  Click the "Browse ..." button and
        hold down the control key as you select directories
        (or use the shift key to select a range).  The
        assembler command will include a -I option for
        each directory.

      - You can now edit the assembler command directly.

There are new timers that indicate elapsed wallclock time,
elapsed simulator time, and estimated elapsed 1401 time
while your program is executing.

  - In the EXEC window, click the "Timers ..." button.

  - In the TIMERS window, click the "Set speed" button to
    set the speed of your host machine.  Then click the "OK" button.

  - The estimated elapsed 1401 time is a VERY rough estimate.
    It's useful only if you run your program without breakpoints
    and without single- or auto-stepping.

  - Sorry, the timer values don't update until SIMH releases control.
